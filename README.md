##Abstract:
[EduLink is a course recommendation system that leverages graph-based representation learning techniques. Using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), EduLink learns embeddings for courses and associated features, enabling efficient similarity calculations. The system constructs a multipartite graph of courses, skills, and descriptions, allowing users to filter courses based on selected skills. Recommendations are tailored to user queries and preferences using cosine similarity. Implemented with Streamlit, EduLink offers a user-friendly interface for exploring relevant Coursera courses. By integrating graph-based learning with natural language processing for text preprocessing, EduLink empowers users to make informed decisions and optimize their learning journey.]
